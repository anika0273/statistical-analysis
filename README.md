# Vaccine Quality Assurance Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the quality and effectiveness of the sixth batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses manufactured by Medicon. The analysis includes:

1. **Quality Assurance Testing**:
   - **Probability Distributions**: Determine the likelihood of unsatisfactory doses.
   - **Statistical Probability**: Calculate the probability of doses not meeting satisfactory standards.

2. **Effectiveness Analysis**:
   - **Time of Effect**: Analyze the time required for the vaccine to show its effects based on sample data.
   - **Percentiles and Confidence Intervals**: Determine key statistical measures for the time of effect.

## Analysis Questions

### Q1. Quality Assurance Testing

1. **Plot Probability Distribution**:
   - Plot the probability distribution for the number of unsatisfactory doses out of 100 doses.

2. **Exact Probability Calculation**:
   - Find the probability that exactly 3 doses will not do a satisfactory job out of 100 doses.

3. **At Most Probability Calculation**:
   - Determine the probability that at most 3 doses will not do a satisfactory job out of 100 doses.

### Q2. Effectiveness Probability

- **At Least 30 Unsatisfactory Doses**:
  - Calculate the probability that at least 30 doses out of 200 will not do a satisfactory job.

### Q3. Time of Effect Analysis

1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Calculate the probability that the time of effect is less than 11.5 hours based on sample data.

2. **90th Percentile**:
   - Find the 90th percentile of the time of effect.

3. **Confidence Interval**:
   - Estimate the range for the population mean time of effect with a 95% confidence level.

## Dataset

- **doses.csv**: Contains time of effect data for 50 doses used in the effectiveness analysis.
